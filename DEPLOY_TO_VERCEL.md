# Deploying Laravel to Vercel (Not Recommended)

⚠️ **Warning**: Vercel is designed for frontend frameworks and serverless functions. Laravel requires a full PHP runtime, which Vercel doesn't natively support well.

## Why Vercel Isn't Ideal for Laravel

- ❌ No native PHP runtime
- ❌ No persistent storage
- ❌ Database connections are tricky
- ❌ Background jobs don't work
- ❌ File uploads are problematic

## Alternative: Hybrid Approach

If you must use Vercel, split your app:

1. **Backend (Laravel API)** → Deploy to Railway/Render
   - Full Laravel functionality
   - Database access
   - File storage

2. **Frontend (Next.js/React)** → Deploy to Vercel
   - Call Laravel API
   - Fast edge delivery

## If You Still Want to Try Vercel

### Option 1: Use Vercel PHP Runtime (Experimental)

Create `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "public/index.php",
      "use": "@vercel/php"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/.*",
      "dest": "public/index.php"
    }
  ],
  "env": {
    "APP_ENV": "production"
  }
}
```

**Limitations:**
- Requires database hosted elsewhere
- Storage must be S3 or similar
- Complex setup
- Many Laravel features won't work

### Option 2: Serverless Functions (Recommended if using Vercel)

Convert Laravel routes to Vercel serverless functions. This requires significant refactoring.

## Recommended: Deploy to Railway Instead

Railway is **much better** for Laravel:

1. Sign up at https://railway.app
2. Connect GitHub
3. Select your repository
4. Railway auto-detects Laravel
5. Add MySQL database
6. Set environment variables
7. Deploy!

**Railway advantages:**
- ✅ Native PHP support
- ✅ Easy database setup
- ✅ Persistent storage
- ✅ Background jobs work
- ✅ Auto HTTPS
- ✅ Free tier available

See `SETUP_GITHUB.md` for Railway deployment instructions.
