=== IMMEDIATE FIX FOR BROKEN PHOTOS ===

Run this command to fix all photo references:

    php artisan photos:update-refs --team="BRITISH ROYALS"

This updates the database to match existing photo files.

If PHP is not in PATH, use the full path to PHP.

After running, refresh your browser - photos should appear!
